## Next stop the Island

Next stop on our camping holiday was Stradbroke Island aka Minjerrabah, Straddie, paradise. This place is just a 45 min drive and a 45 min ferry ride from Brisbane. There are several camp sites to stay on. Our favorite one, that we keeops coming back to is Adder Rock where we can pitch our tent just 10 meters behind the beach.

We tend to meet up with friends of ours who introduced us to the place, who have three kids just the same ages as ours. Playmates are a really lovely thing when it comes to camping. We had hardly arrived before they all ran off to the beach and were gone for 2 hours. Meanwhile __ we managed to get up the tent and awning just before the rain started pouring down. The stress.



Simple life.
