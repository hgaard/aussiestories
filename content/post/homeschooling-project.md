Hi friends and family

We are now ready to launch our homeschooling project Jolly Jimmy.We set out to create a business as part of homeschooling and have the kids learn on the way and have them decide what to do.

The result - an online shop where we sell bold tie dye tees made by the 3 of them (with some help from us).

Have a look at [https://jolly-jimmy.weeblysite.com/](https://jolly-jimmy.weeblysite.com/) and put in an order if you like what you see ;)
